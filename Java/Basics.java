Abstraction can be achived 100% by using interface (Showing the neccessary information)
Encapsulation can be achieved by declaring all the variables in a class as private and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of the variables.
(encapsulation can also interchangebly used for Data hiding)
INHERITANCE
//base class or parent class or super class
class A{
  //parent class methods
  void method1(){}
  void method2(){}
}

//derived class or child class or base class
class B extends A{  //Inherits parent class methods
  //child class methods
  void method3(){}
  void method4(){}
}

 The ability to appear in many forms is called polymorphism.
Note: Polymorphism in Java is mainly of 2 types: 

Overloading => 
Overriding  => 
A wrapper class wraps (encloses) around a data type and gives it an object appearance. Wrapper classes are final and immutable. Two concepts are there in the wrapper classes namely autoboxing and unboxing.
